## Database

### CAP Theorem (Brewer's theorem)

In a distributed database/system, you cannot simultaneously guarantee all three of these properties:

- **Consistency (C)**

  - Every read gets the most recent write (all nodes see the same data at the same time).
  - Example: If I write X=10, any read immediately after should return 10.

- **Availability (A)**

  - Every request receives a response, even if it might not be the latest version of the data.
  - System stays responsive even under failure.

- **Partition Tolerance (P)**

  - The system continues to function despite network partitions (nodes not being able to communicate).

CAP theorem says:
In the presence of a **network partition**, you must choose between **Consistency** and **Availability**.

### Trade-offs (CA, CP, AP)

- **CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance)**

  - Sacrifice availability during network failures.
  - Strongly consistent systems. (e.g. Banking Systems)
  - Example: HBase, MongoDB (with strong consistency configs).

- **AP (Availability + Partition tolerance)**

  - Sacrifice strict consistency ‚Üí eventual consistency is allowed.
  - Prioritize always responding, even if data might be stale. (e.g. Social Media Feeds)
  - Example: Cassandra, DynamoDB.

- **CA (Consistency + Availability)**

  - Theoretically possible only if no network partitions exist ‚Üí not practical in distributed systems.
  - Example: traditional single-node RDBMS (like PostgreSQL on one machine).

---

### ACID

`ACID` is a set of properties that guarantee reliable transactions in databases (especially relational ones like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).

1. **Atomicity**

   - "All or nothing."
   - A transaction is indivisible: either all operations succeed, or none do.
   - Example: In a money transfer:
     - Deduct $100 from Alice
     - Add $100 to Bob
     - If adding fails, the deduction is rolled back.

2. **Consistency**

   - Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another valid state, following all rules, constraints, and triggers.
   - Example: If a column must be unique, inserting a duplicate violates consistency ‚Üí transaction fails.

3. **Isolation**

   - Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other.
   - Intermediate states are not visible to other transactions.
   - Different isolation levels exist:
     - Read Uncommitted (dirty reads allowed)
     - Read Committed
     - Repeatable Read
     - Serializable (highest, behaves like transactions are sequential).

4. **Durability**

   - Once a transaction is committed, it is permanent, even if the system crashes right after.
   - Achieved via **write-ahead logs (WALs)**, **replication**, and **persistent storage**.

---

### BASE

Many NoSQL databases (Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB, etc.) follow the BASE model to favor scalability and availability in distributed systems.

1. **Basically Available**

- The system guarantees availability, but not necessarily consistency at all times.
- Even under failure, it tries to respond ‚Äî possibly with stale data.
- Example: Amazon DynamoDB or Cassandra nodes may return older values instead of failing.

2. **Soft State**

- The system state may change over time, even without input.
- Because of replication and eventual consistency, different nodes may temporarily hold different values.
- Example: A write to one replica may not immediately be visible on another.

3. **Eventual Consistency**

- Given enough time (assuming no new updates), all replicas will converge to the same state.
- Strong consistency is sacrificed for performance and fault tolerance.
- Example: In Cassandra, a read might not show the latest write, but eventually all nodes sync up.

### ACID Vs. BASE

| Property     | **ACID**                                                    | **BASE**                                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistency  | Strong consistency                                          | Eventual consistency                                                        |
| Availability | Can sacrifice availability (during conflicts or partitions) | Prioritizes availability                                                    |
| Use Case     | Banking, reservations, systems needing strong guarantees    | Large-scale distributed systems, social media, e-commerce with huge traffic |

### Choosing a Database

1. **Data Model & Structure**

- If data is highly relational with complex joins, foreign keys, and transactions ‚Üí a Relational DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) makes sense.
- If data is document-oriented, hierarchical, or schema-flexible (e.g., product catalogs, JSON-like structures) ‚Üí a Document Store (MongoDB, Couchbase) is better.
- If workload is time-series (metrics, IoT, monitoring) ‚Üí use a Time-Series DB (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).
- If workload is graph-like (social networks, recommendation engines) ‚Üí a Graph DB (Neo4j, ArangoDB) fits best.

2. **Consistency vs Availability (CAP theorem)**

- If the system needs strict correctness (e.g., financial transactions) ‚Üí choose a strongly consistent ACID DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).
- If the system prioritizes high availability and scale (e.g., social feeds, analytics) ‚Üí a BASE / eventually consistent DB (Cassandra, DynamoDB) is more suitable.

3. **Scalability Requirements**

- For a single-region, moderate traffic system ‚Üí vertical scaling with a relational DB works well.
- For globally distributed, high-traffic apps ‚Üí need a horizontally scalable DB like Cassandra, DynamoDB, or CockroachDB.

4. **Query Patterns & Access Needs (Read/Write Heavy)**

- Do we need ad-hoc queries, aggregations, joins? ‚Üí SQL databases shine.
- Do we mostly fetch by key/value lookups? ‚Üí Key-Value stores (Redis, DynamoDB).
- Do we need real-time analytics? ‚Üí Columnar DBs (ClickHouse, BigQuery).

5. **Transaction Requirements**

- Strong transactional integrity (ACID) ‚Üí SQL DBs (Postgres, MySQL).
- Eventual consistency is okay (shopping cart, likes, logs) ‚Üí NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra).

6. **Ecosystem, Tooling & Operational Overhead**

- Does the team have experience with SQL or NoSQL?
- Is there cloud-native support (AWS RDS, DynamoDB, GCP Spanner)?
- Do we need easy migrations, backups, replication?

- **Example**

  - Banking system / Payment gateway ‚Üí PostgreSQL (ACID, strong consistency).
  - Social media feed ‚Üí Cassandra / DynamoDB (BASE, high availability).
  - Product catalog with flexible schema ‚Üí MongoDB.
  - Analytics dashboard ‚Üí ClickHouse or BigQuery.
  - Cache / Session store ‚Üí Redis.

### Isolation Levels

Concurrency Anomalies to Know:

- **Dirty Read** ‚Äì A transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction.
- **Non-Repeatable Read** ‚Äì A transaction reads the same row twice and gets different results (because another transaction updated it in between).
- **Phantom Read** ‚Äì A transaction re-runs a query (e.g., SELECT ... WHERE condition) and new rows appear/disappear (because another transaction inserted/deleted rows).

- **Read Uncommitted (Lowest level)**

  - ‚úÖ Allows dirty reads.
  - Transactions can see uncommitted changes from others.
  - Rarely used in practice (can lead to inconsistent states).
  - Example use: analytics queries where stale data is acceptable.

- **Read Committed**

  - üö´ Prevents dirty reads.
  - Each read sees only committed data.
  - But still allows non-repeatable reads and phantoms.
  - This is the default in PostgreSQL & Oracle.

- **Repeatable Read**

  - üö´ Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
  - Guarantees that if you read a row twice in the same transaction, it won‚Äôt change.
  - Still allows phantom reads (new rows might appear that match the query condition).
  - This is the default in MySQL (InnoDB).

- **Serializable (Highest level)**

  - üö´ Prevents all three anomalies (dirty, non-repeatable, phantom).
  - Transactions are executed as if they were serial (one after another).
  - Strongest guarantee but lowest concurrency (can cause locking/contention).
  - Best for financial apps requiring correctness over performance.

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Read Uncommitted | ‚úÖ Allowed | ‚úÖ Allowed          | ‚úÖ Allowed   |
| Read Committed   | ‚ùå No      | ‚úÖ Allowed          | ‚úÖ Allowed   |
| Repeatable Read  | ‚ùå No      | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Allowed   |
| Serializable     | ‚ùå No      | ‚ùå No               | ‚ùå No        |

### Primary Indexing Vs. Secondary Indexing

- **Primary Index**

  - Built on the primary key (or clustering key) of a table.
  - The data file itself is ordered by this key (clustered index).
  - Each table can have only one primary index.
  - Lookup is very fast because the index order matches the physical storage order.

- **Secondary Index**

  - Built on non-primary key attributes (non-clustering key).
  - The data file is not ordered by this key.
  - A table can have multiple secondary indexes.
  - Provides fast lookups on attributes other than the primary key.
  - Usually implemented with an extra pointer (row ID / primary key reference) that links back to the actual row.Think of it as an extra search table that helps find rows quickly without scanning everything.
  - too many secondary indexes slow down writes (since every insert/update must update all relevant indexes).

| Feature             | Primary Index                         | Secondary Index                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Key Type**        | Built on primary key / clustering key | Built on non-primary key columns       |
| **Ordering**        | Data stored in order of index         | Data not stored in index order         |
| **Count per Table** | Only one                              | Many allowed                           |
| **Access Method**   | Direct, since data is aligned         | Needs extra lookup (to row/primary)    |
| **Performance**     | Faster for key-based searches         | Slight overhead (extra pointer lookup) |
