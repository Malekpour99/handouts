## Algorithms & Data-structures (Live Code)

- **Two Sum** -> find the first two members of an array which their sum equals a target number.
- **Roman to Integer** -> convert roman numbers to integers.
- **Palindrome** -> determine whether a text/string/number is mirrored or not.
- **The N-Nearest drives** -> create an efficient way to find 'N' nearest drivers to a passenger (hint: an optimized way is using a min-heap)
- **Vectors** -> a class for storing vectors' X and Y coordinates and modify it so that these vectors can add-up with each other and print them in a customized way.
- **Linked List** -> Create a function which removes the third-to-last node from a singly-linked-list. (Solve in `O(n)` time complexity)
- **List** -> Create a function which converts a multi-level nested-list to a flat list.
- **List** -> Given a price-per-day list (like this `[7, 1, 5, 3, 4, 6, 2]`) find the best day to buy and to sell which gives you the highest profit (e.g. buy at `1` and sell at `6`). (Solve in `O(n)` time complexity).
- **Graph** -> Given a list of answers for all of the students (e.g. `student_id, question_id, answer`), find the students whom their answers match more than 80%.

## Design Systems

- Teck-Growth (Kuwait) -> Design Tweeter from the ground up
- Mahsan -> Consider we have a project with 100,000 RPS and these requests data is written on files, design a system for reading and processing that data
- Maktabkhoone -> Consider we have two postgres databases and a partition happens between them; what happens now?
- Melli-Gold -> Design a shopping cart for purchasing products (handle race conditions for buying limited products, show an estimated number of remaining products for clients, manage different stages of payment for finalizing the purchase)
- Snapp -> Design an application for selling theater tickets (handle race-conditions and consider a very high-load from customers for buying tickets, manage different payment stages, prevent over-selling the same seats)

## Projects

- Torna-System -> File-Manager
- Invex -> Block-Chain Wallet
- Faraswap -> User registration + Wallet (live-code Python-Django)
- Asan Pardakht -> Read from multiple text files and give a word count as final result (live-code GO)
- Porsline -> Recommendation system based on user history and activity
- Mofid Securities -> Create a decorator which tracks the time of execution for any function
- Toman -> E-commerce CRUD endpoints
- Torob -> Read, integrate and sort weather reports from a file (live-code)
- Iran-SOS -> Fix endpoints different bugs [unapplied migration bug, N+1 query bug] (live-code Python-Django)
- Remote Synergy (Partnerz) -> Refactor a SMTP mailing service
- Maktabkhoone -> Design signals based on the observer design pattern (signal register + triggering) (live-code Python)
