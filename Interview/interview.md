## Algorithms & Data-structures (Live Code)

- **Two Sum** -> find the first two members of an array which their sum equals a target number.
- **Roman to Integer** -> convert roman numbers to integers.
- **Palindrome** -> determine whether a text/string/number is mirrored or not.
- **The N-Nearest drives** -> create an efficient way to find 'N' nearest drivers to a passenger (hint: an optimized way is using a min-heap)
- **Vectors** -> a class for storing vectors' X and Y coordinates and modify it so that these vectors can add-up with each other and print them in a customized way.

## Design Systems

- Design tweeter from the ground up
- Consider we have a project with 100,000 RPS and these requests data is written on files, design a system for reading and using that data
- Consider we have two postgres databases and a partition happens between them; what happens now?
- Design a shopping cart for purchasing products (handle race conditions for buying limited products, show an estimated number of remaining products for clients, manage different stages of payment for finalizing the purchase)
