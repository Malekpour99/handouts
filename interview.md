## Programming & Python

### Why python? What are its pros and cons?

- Python is my main programming language because of its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **wide ecosystem**. It allows me to write clean, maintainable code quickly, which is ideal for both prototyping and production-level applications.
- Pros of Python:
  1. **Readability & Simplicity**  
     Python’s syntax is clean and expressive, resembling pseudo-code. This makes it easier to read, debug, and onboard new team members quickly.

  2. **Large Ecosystem**  
     Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks. For web development, I use **Django** and **FastAPI**, while for data tasks, libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** are widely used.

  3. **Vibrant Community**  
     A huge open-source community means lots of support, regular updates, and mature third-party packages.

  4. **Cross-domain Usage**  
     Python is versatile — used in web development, data science, scripting, automation, DevOps, machine learning, and more. That means my Python skills transfer across multiple domains.

  5. **Integration Capabilities**  
     Python plays well with other languages and systems via APIs, bindings, and tools like Cython or PyBind.

- Cons of Python:
  1. **Performance**  
     Being an interpreted and dynamically typed language, Python can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. But this is often mitigated using tools like **C extensions** or offloading performance-heavy parts to optimized services.

  2. **Mobile Development**  
     Not ideal for mobile app development. Other languages and platforms (like Swift or Kotlin) are better suited for that domain.

  3. **Threading Limitations (GIL)**  
     The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound multi-threaded applications. However, it can be worked around using multiprocessing or by delegating heavy tasks to external services.

  4. **Runtime Errors**  
     Being dynamically typed, Python may have more runtime errors if type hints or proper testing aren’t enforced.
